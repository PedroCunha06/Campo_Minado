# Campo Minado
Test game in Java. 

In it, the players must make their way across the map, taking care that no mine ends up blowing up, otherwise, of course, 
you will have to start a new game without getting a second chance.
## How play?
- When you start a match, you don't have to worry about the first move, since there is no chance that you will lose.
- After you have made your first move, among the squares that are still enabled, you will see that some of them have numbers on them. These numbers represent the amount of mines you have next to them, so, for example, it is never a
    good idea to open a square to a high side number, because in it you will have a higher chance of exploding a mine.
- You win the game by finding all the houses without touching the mines
